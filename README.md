# Barter-it!

## Description

Barter-it! is a wep application that looks to help people and auto-suficient 
communities to trade products without the need of money.
We know that money is present in everyday life and that there is a 
reason for it to exist, so we didn't erase it completely of the equation, we
just made it another secondary product more.

This web application is developed in MeteorJS, with React for the front-end.
